    """Hook before the agent starts.

    This hook is useful to shortcut the Cat response.
    If you do not want the agent to run, return the final response from here and it will end up in the chat without the agent being executed.

    Parameters
    --------
    agent_input: dict
        Input that is about to be passed to the agent.
    cat : CheshireCat
        Cheshire Cat instance.

    Returns
    --------
    response : Union[None, Dict]
        Cat response if you want to avoid using the agent, or None if you want the agent to be executed.
        See below for examples of Cat response

    Examples
    --------

    Example 1: can't talk about this topic
    ```python
    # here you could use cat._llm to do topic evaluation
    if "dog" in agent_input["input"]:
        return {
            "output": "You went out of topic. Can't talk about dog."
        }
    ```

    Example 2: don't remember (no uploaded documents about topic)
    ```python
    num_declarative_memories = len( cat.working_memory["declarative_memories"] )
    log(num_declarative_memories, "ERROR")
    if num_declarative_memories == 0:
        return {

    Parameters
    --------
    tool: BaseTool

    Example 1: add a procedural memory after a tool is used
    ```python
